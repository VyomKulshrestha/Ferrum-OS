# FerrumOS on the Georgia Tech Robotarium

Real robots for the vision-caution work: robot 0 plays the FerrumOS robot and robot 1 a
parked obstacle in the Robotarium arena (free remote testbed, robotarium.gatech.edu).
Each runtime step is a FerrumOS `PhysicalAction` from the same generator as the
runtime-scene proxy, scaled 0.7 (the runtime geofence becomes a projected 1.4 m square;
the 16 cm runtime robot becomes 11.2 cm, about a GRITSbot).

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `ferrum_experiment.py` | the file to upload; numpy + `rps` only; edit `SEED` per submission |
| `check_in_simulator.py` | runs the upload file in the official simulator and reports the testbed's own checks |
| `label_robotarium_log.py` | labels a returned run with the runtime's hazard rules (body centres) |
| `video_frames.py` | syncs the returned video to the log, fits the camera, writes rectified per-step frames |

Testbed limits respected: 600 s per experiment (8 episodes take about 450 s), no robot
pair within 0.135 m (a local safety layer keeps robot 0 at least 0.20 m from the
obstacle), no robot outside the arena, wheel speeds kept under 90% of the motor limit.
Real contact is never produced, so the Robotarium labels cover proximity and geofence
exit only.

## Pilot (seed 101)

Ran on 2026-10-22 with the version at commit 46a590a. The testbed returned our three data
files, a log and a 1920x1080, 25 fps overhead video (wide-angle lens, strong barrel
distortion). The white projected fence was invisible on the bright floor; the projector
darkens by withholding light, so the fence is now black and 10 px wide, and a dark disc is
projected under the parked obstacle so the two identical GRITSbots differ visually.

What the pilot taught the tooling:
- Real execution matches the simulator: Move end-to-target error median 1.7 cm (sim 2.1),
  79% within 3 cm (sim 71%), drift while holding at most 3 mm.
- The testbed loop runs about 1% slow with +-0.2 s jitter, so the video is synced per
  30 s window, and the camera is fitted only on hold frames (robots still).
- The logged pose is behind the visible body centre along the heading (fitted 3.1 cm;
  the testbed's collision check uses 0.025 m). Labels use body centres with 0.025 m.
- OpenCV's full camera model diverges from a single plane; a homography plus one radial
  term fits all 555 hold frames at 1.0 px median (0.2 cm).
- Exploratory only: the sim-trained v2 head, unchanged, scored AUC-PR 0.717 against a
  0.455 base rate on the pilot's 88 decisions (recall 0.275 at its frozen threshold,
  FPR 0.021). One run; not evidence.

## Check before uploading

The simulator and `cvxopt` live in a separate venv so the main environment is untouched:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium_python_simulator target/robotarium/robotarium_python_simulator
python -m venv target/robotarium/venv
target/robotarium/venv/Scripts/python -m pip install numpy==2.2.6 matplotlib==3.10.8 cvxopt==1.3.2
target/robotarium/venv/Scripts/python scripts/robotarium/check_in_simulator.py --seeds 101 102 103
```

Seeds 101-103 pass with zero too-close, out-of-bounds and actuator-limit counts.

## After a run

Put the run's data files, log and video (`experiment_video.mp4`) in one folder, then:

```bash
python scripts/robotarium/label_robotarium_log.py path/to/run --out path/to/run/labels.npz
python scripts/robotarium/video_frames.py path/to/run
```

`frames.npz` has the keys of the proxy dataset, so `vision_runtime_proxy_final.decisions`
reads it unchanged.

Pilot runs (seeds 101-110) are exploratory: they show what the testbed returns (data, and
whether a video comes back). Any evaluation on Robotarium footage needs its own protocol
registered before the runs it scores.
